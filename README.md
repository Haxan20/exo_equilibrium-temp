# exo_equilibrium-temp
This is 100% a python GUI simulator, which focus on simulating the equilibrium temperature of exoplanet 
it also compares the results of the exoplanet's equilibrium temperature with that of the earth surface 
it is 100% dependent on the tkinter liberary of the python software 
this project is limited to the fact that it doesn't take into consideration the atmospheric composition as well as the surface characteristics of the exoplanets, thereby limiting the accuracy of the results
